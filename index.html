    <p>ABOUT ME</p>
        <div>
            <p>I am an 18 year old lady and yeah i am fresh out of high school. I reside in Nakuru as for now but will later on be joining Kenyatta University to persue my career in Bachelor of arts majoring in either planning or economics because i have not really made up my mind.</p>
            <p>I decided to this class on programming because as we all know in today's world if you have more than one career you have a higher chance of getting a good job that will be able to feed you. I also would like to be the very first and the most youngest lady programmer in the country if not the whole world.</p>
